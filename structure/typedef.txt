typedef in C
The typedef is a keyword used in C programming to provide some meaningful names to the already existing variable in the C program. 
It behaves similarly as we define the alias for the commands. In short, we can say that this keyword is used to redefine the name 
of an already existing variable.

Syntax of typedef
typedef <existing_name> <alias_name>

struct student  
{  
char name[20];  
int age;  
};  
typedef struct student stud;  
stud s1, s2;   

The above typedef can be written as:

typedef struct student  
{  
char name[20];  
int age;   
} stud;  
stud s1,s2;  

From the above declarations, we conclude that typedef keyword reduces the length of the code and complexity of data types. 
It also helps in understanding the program.


Using typedef with pointers
We can also provide another name or alias name to the pointer variables with the help of the typedef.

typedef int* ptr;  
ptr p1, p2 ;  
In the above statement, p1 and p2 are the variables of type 'ptr'.
